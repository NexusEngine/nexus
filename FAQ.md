## What is Nexus Engine?

Nexus Engine is - or rather, will be - a next-generation multiplayer game engine
back-end.

Wow, that's a mouth-full. But what does that actually mean? Nexus Engine is
designed to function as a game server in a multiplayer environment. This
description remains intentionally broad, because the core of the engine itself
is abstract and extensible. Most functionality - including what can be
considered core functionality, will be implemented as _mods_.

The extreme extensibility of Nexus Engine will allow you to build your own game
server back-end without having to worry about the details and without
compromizing on functionality.

## Does the project follow semver?

Versions lower than 1.0.0 do not.

## When will version 1 be released?

There currently isn't a roadmap for version 1. The development of the engine is
in its early stages and as such it is impossible to make a prediction.

## How can I contribute to the project?

Contributions are more than welcome. Read our
[contributing page](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more.

## Why are all packages in a single repository?

It's called a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo).
