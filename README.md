# Nexus Engine

![CI](https://github.com/NexusEngine/nexus/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)

**Nexus Engine** is -- or rather, will be -- a next-generation multiplayer game
engine back-end.

Developed specifically for text-based browser games, the core of the engine is
an abstract beast which can be extensively modified using **mods**.

> **Work is currently progressing**. The project is in its early stages, and you
> are watching a work-in-progress.

Developed with :heart: by [Art of Coding](https://artofcoding.nl).
